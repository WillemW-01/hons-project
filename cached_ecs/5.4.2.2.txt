NAME        phosphoglucomutase (alpha-D-glucose-1,6-bisphosphate-dependent);
            glucose phosphomutase (ambiguous);
            phosphoglucose mutase (ambiguous)
CLASS       Isomerases;
            Intramolecular transferases;
            Phosphotransferases (phosphomutases)
SYSNAME     alpha-D-glucose 1,6-phosphomutase
REACTION    alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate = D-glucose 6-phosphate [RN:R08639]
ALL_REAC    R08639 > R00959;
            (other) R01057 R03319
SUBSTRATE   alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate [CPD:C00103]
PRODUCT     D-glucose 6-phosphate [CPD:C00092]
COMMENT     Maximum activity is only obtained in the presence of alpha-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. This bisphosphate is an intermediate in the reaction, being formed by transfer of a phosphate residue from the enzyme to the substrate, but the dissociation of bisphosphate from the enzyme complex is much slower than the overall isomerization. The enzyme also catalyses (more slowly) the interconversion of 1-phosphate and 6-phosphate isomers of many other alpha-D-hexoses, and the interconversion of alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate and 5-phosphate. cf. EC 5.4.2.5, phosphoglucomutase (glucose-cofactor).
