            gene lon proteins;
            PIM1 protease;
            PIM1 proteinase;
            serine protease La
CLASS       Hydrolases;
            Acting on peptide bonds (peptidases);
            Serine endopeptidases
REACTION    Hydrolysis of proteins in presence of ATP
COMMENT     Product of the lon gene in Escherichia coli. ATP hydrolysis is linked with peptide bond hydrolysis; vanadate inhibits both reactions. Type example of peptidase family S16. A similar enzyme occurs in animal mitochondria
