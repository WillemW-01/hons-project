SYSNAME     S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (cytidine1402-2'-O)-methyltransferase
REACTION    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine1402 in 16S rRNA = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine1402 in 16S rRNA
SUBSTRATE   S-adenosyl-L-methionine [CPD:C00019];
            cytidine1402 in 16S rRNA
PRODUCT     S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [CPD:C00021];
            2'-O-methylcytidine1402 in 16S rRNA
COMMENT     RsmI catalyses the 2'-O-methylation of cytidine1402 and RsmH (EC 2.1.1.199) catalyses the N4-methylation of cytidine1402 in 16S rRNA. Both methylations are necessary for efficient translation initiation at the UUG and GUG codons.
