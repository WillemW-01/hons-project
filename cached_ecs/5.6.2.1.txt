CLASS       Isomerases;
            Isomerases altering macromolecular conformation;
            Enzymes altering nucleic acid conformation
SYSNAME     DNA topoisomerase
REACTION    ATP-independent breakage of single-stranded DNA, followed by passage and rejoining
COMMENT     These enzymes bring about the conversion of one topological isomer of DNA into another, e.g., the relaxation of superhelical turns in DNA, the interconversion of simple and knotted rings of single-stranded DNA, and the intertwisting of single-stranded rings of complementary sequences, cf. EC 5.6.2.2 DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing).
