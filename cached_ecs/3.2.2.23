SYSNAME     DNA glycohydrolase [2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-(N-methyl)formamidopyrimide releasing]
REACTION    Hydrolysis of DNA containing ring-opened 7-methylguanine residues, releasing 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-(N-methyl)formamidopyrimidine
COMMENT     May play a significant role in processes leading to recovery from mutagenesis and/or cell death by alkylating agents. Also involved in the GO system responsible for removing an oxidatively damaged form of guanine (7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine) from DNA.
