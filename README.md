# hons-project
The code in this project serves to build a directed graph representing a metabolic network. The main file takes in an input file with a list of EC numbers, and a second parameter for the job_name. The output will be a job_name_nodes.gdf file that can be loaded into the program Gephi for visualization. Also included is a job_name.log.
